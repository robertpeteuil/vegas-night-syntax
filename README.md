## Vegas Night Syntax Theme

A Dark theme with vibrant colors so that everything is easily readable.  Most Dark themes tend to use heavily muted colors that are difficult to read code. 

Originally based off the One Dark Syntax Theme, and it works well with the One Dark [UI theme](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-ui).
