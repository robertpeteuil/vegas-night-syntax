## Vegas Night Syntax Theme

A Dark theme with vibrant colors so that everything (even comments) is easily readable.  I started this theme because every dark theme I tested used heavily muted colors and the comments were so dark I couldn't read them. 

Originally based off the One Dark Syntax Theme, and it works well with the One Dark [UI theme](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-ui).

There will be small incremental updates to adjust issues as discovered.  In particular:
- colors that are too bright in certain scenarios 
- languages that dont work well with the default color scheme
